The homework is divided into following folders:
1. doc
      This folder contains Solution to Problem 1 in Problem_1_Solution.odt 
      and the changes made for Problem 2 are stored in Problem_2_Solution.odt
      The man page for the system call date is present in manpage.odt and 
      diff for all the files that were modified is present in diff folder.
      Date_Testing.odt contains the information about how the testing was done for This
      system call.

2. executable
      This contains the solution to problem 2 that is implementation of date() system call.
      Please run the following to see the date() system call working:
      a. make qemu-nox
      b. date

      The above command will print out UTC date & time in hour:min:sec mm-dd-yyyy format like:
      
      Current UTC date & time is 2:3:30 10-4-2019

      For testing, you can run date_testing using the following command:
      a. date_testing

3.src
      This folder contains only modified files for the implementation of date
      system call. Also it contains the user level programs date.c and
      date_testing.c. date.c implements date system call and date_testing.c
      tests the date system call. You can just use executable folder to test the 
      working of date system call.
